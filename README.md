# 🍃 Coronavirus Map
Check the coronavirus status of any country easily and efficiently.

## Motivation
I wanted to learn Gatsby but did not know where to start. I stumbled upon Leaflet and it seemed the perfect way to get into Gatsby development. BUTTTT 🍑 ... I actually cloned this project from this [Github repository](https://github.com/amidabrian51/my-coronovirus-map.git) so this is not really my project.

## TODO
- Fix dependency issues.
- Find alternatives to the various deperecated dependencies currently in use.
- Better map markers on the GeoJSON layer.
- Better and more informative (info dense) dialogs on map marker hover.
- Sharing the status of a country.
