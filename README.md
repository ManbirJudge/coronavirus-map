## Motivation
I wanted to learn Gatsby but didon't know where to start. I stumbled upon Leaflet and it seemed the perfect way to get into Gatsby development. BUT... I actually cloned this project from this [Github repo](https://github.com/amidabrian51/my-coronovirus-map.git) so this isn't really my project.

## TODOs
- Fix undepreceated dependency issues. `!important`
- Better map markers on the GeoJSON layer.
- Better and more informative dialogs on map marker hover.
- Ability to share.
- Ability to change map service.
- Cleanup SASS. `!important`
- Cleanup JS.
- Add manifest and icon using `gatsby-plugin-manifest`. `!important`
